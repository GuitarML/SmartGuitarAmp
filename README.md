Guitar plugin made with JUCE that uses neural network models to emulate real world hardware.

See video demo on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/oIX5y-nyhcY)

This plugin uses a WaveNet model to recreate the sound of real world hardware. The current version
models a small tube amp, with the ability to add more options in the future. There is a clean/lead channel, 
which is equivalent to the amp's clean and full drive settings. Gain and EQ knobs were added to 
modulate the modeled sound.

You can create your own models and load them in SmartGuitarAmp with minor code modifications.
To train your own models, use [PedalNetRT](https://github.com/GuitarML/PedalNetRT)

Model training is done using PyTorch on pre recorded .wav samples. More info in the above repository.
To share your best models, email the json files to smartguitarml@gmail.com and they may be included 
in the latest release as a downloadable zip.

## Installing the plugin

1. Download plugin (Windows 10, Mac, Ubuntu Linux) [here](https://github.com/keyth72/SmartGuitarAmp/releases)
2. Copy to your DAW's VST directory (for Mac, use .dmg installer or copy AU/VST3 to desired folder)

## Build Instructions

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Download and install [JUCE](https://juce.com/) This project uses the "Projucer" application from the JUCE website. 
3. Download [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org)
   Extract Eigen to a convenient location on your system (will be linked with Projucer)
4. Open SmartGuitarPedal.jucer file with Projucer
5. Add the <full_path_to>/ Eigen folder to "Header Search Paths" in Exporters -> Debug/Release
6. Open and build project in Visual Studio (Windows), Xcode (Mac), or Code::Blocks/Makefile (Linux)

Note: Make sure to build in Release mode unless actually debugging. Debug mode will not keep up with real time playing.

## Using your own custom trained models (or models from the TonePack)

Use the "Load Tone" button in the plugin to load tone models trained with PedalNetRT.  The current channel's 
EQ/gain will be applied to the custom tone.  Switching the clean/lead channel unloads the custom tone and 
reloads the channel's default tone.
